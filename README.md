## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- ES6 Javascript classes

### Continued development

I'm going to study something about Design Patterns. Now I can't tell if my Javascript code is well structured. I tried to arrange the code following a logical method that I figured out during the process, but I'm not sure that would be accepted in a real production environment.

I also would like to get better at naming variables, functions ecc... English is not my native language so I'm often not sure if the name I choose is precise and exaustive to describe what the variable stores or what a function does. Maybe I should read more code made by others.
